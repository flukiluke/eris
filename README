Eris - 2016

Dependencies:
 - Install discord.py from https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
 - Install pexpect from pip if you don't already have it
 - Compile frotz (http://frotz.sourceforge.net/) in dumb mode and get ZORK1.DAT
   from http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html

This is a small and useless bot for use on Discord. Before running it for the
first time, you will need to create an application with a bot user at
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me then copy the bot user token
into the eris.json config file. Then, invite it to a server by visiting
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123&scope=bot&permissions=3072
where client_id is the client ID listed on the Application's page.

eris.json contains a JSON-encoded object holding all configuration options. They
are listed below:

- channels (array of strings): If non-empty, Eris will only respond on channels
  with these names. If empty, it responds on all channels.
- cmd_prefix (string): All bot commands must be prefixed by this string. Usually
  set to a single character such as . or !
- token (string): The unique token corresponding to your application's bot user.
  You will need to supply this yourself.
- game_prefix (string): All text to be send to the currently playing game should
  be prefixed with this.
- games->zork->frotz (string): The path to the frotz binary for running zork.
- games->zork->datafile (string): The path to the ZORK1.DAT file.


The syntax of the commands themselves is quite simple. Either single or double
quotes are required around parameters that contain spaces. Commands list follows:

- game start zork: start a game of Zork.
- game end: End a game of Zork.
- game input <text>: Send <text> to the game being played. Can use the game_prefix
  instead as a shortcut.

(Polling is still in development)
- poll create <pollname> <question> <answer1> <answer2> ...: Create a poll with a
  short name as an identifier, a question to be answered, and as many answers as
  you like.
- poll vote <pollname> <answer>: Set your response to a poll. Re-voting changes
  your vote.
- poll results <pollname>: Show results from a poll.
- poll list: Show all polls with their question and answers.

There are also some fun extras hidden in there for people who like to read the code.
