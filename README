Eris - 2016

Dependencies:
 - Install discord.py from https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
 - bs4

This is a small and useless bot for use on Discord. Before running it for the
first time, you will need to create an application with a bot user at
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me then copy the bot user token
into the eris.json config file. Then, invite it to a server by visiting
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123&scope=bot&permissions=3072
where client_id is the client ID listed on the Application's page.

Copy eris_example.json to eris.json. This contains a JSON-encoded object holding
all configuration options. They are listed below:

- channels (array of strings): If non-empty, Eris will only respond on channels
  with these names. If empty, it responds on all channels.
- cmd_prefix (string): All bot commands must be prefixed by this string. Usually
  set to a single character such as . or !
- token (string): The unique token corresponding to your application's bot user.
  You will need to supply this yourself.

The syntax of the commands themselves is quite simple. Either single or double
quotes are required around parameters that contain spaces. Commands list follows:

- poll create <pollname> <question> <answer1> <answer2> ...: Create a poll with a
  short name as an identifier, a question to be answered, and as many answers as
  you like.
- poll vote <pollname> <answer>: Set your response to a poll. Re-voting changes
  your vote.
- poll results <pollname>: Show results from a poll.
- poll list: Show all polls with their question and answers.
- poll delete <pollname>: Delete a poll forever.

- wa <text>: Make Wolfram Alpha query with brief results
- waa <text>: Make Wolfram Alpha query with extended results

- clear <n>: Delete the n most recent messages in the channel

- tex <maths>: Render maths as LaTeX code (assumed to be between $$)

- metro <train line>: Get the status of <train line> on the Melbourne metro

- weather: Get today's weather

There are also some fun extras hidden in there for people who like to read the code.
