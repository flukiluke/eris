Eris - 2016

Dependencies: Install discord.py from https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

This is a small and useless bot for use on Discord. Before running it for the
first time, you will need to create an application with a bot user at
https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me then copy the bot user token
into the eris.json config file. Then, invite it to a server by visiting
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123&scope=bot&permissions=3072
where client_id is the client ID listed on the Application's page.

eris.json contains a JSON-encoded object holding all configuration options. They
are listed below:

- channels (array of strings): If non-empty, Eris will only respond on channels
  with these names. If empty, it responds on all channels.
- cmd_prefix (string): All bot commands must be prefixed by this string. Usually
  set to a single character such as . or !
- token (string): The unique token corresponding to your application's bot user.
  You will need to supply this yourself.


The syntax of the commands themselves is quite simple. Either single or double
quotes are required around parameters that contain spaces. Commands list follows:

- game <name>: Show the bot as playing <name> in the status pane.

There are also some fun extras hidden in there for people who like to read the code.
