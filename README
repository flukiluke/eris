This is a small and useless bot for use on Discord. Before running it for the
first time, you will need to:

 - Copy eris_example.json to eris.json. This contains a JSON-encoded object
   holding all configuration options. They are listed below.
 - Create an application with a bot user at
   https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me then copy the bot user
   token into the eris.json config file.
 - Obtain API keys for other services as listed in the config file. Feel free
   to ignore some or all of them.
 - Invite it to a server by visiting
   https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123&scope=bot&permissions=3072
   where client_id is the client ID listed on the Application's page.

eris.json settings:
 - token (string): The unique token corresponding to your application's bot user.
   You will need to supply this yourself.
 - main_channel (string): The Discord ID of the channel you want to designate as
   the 'main' channel.
 - cmd_prefix (string): All bot commands must be prefixed by this string. Usually
   set to a single character such as . or !
 - WA_appid (string): API key for Wolfram Alpha
 - NASA-API (string): API keey for NASA
 - quotes_channel (string): Discord ID of channel to listen for quotes in.


The syntax of the commands themselves is quite simple. Either single or double
quotes are required around parameters that contain spaces. Commands list follows:

- poll create <pollname> <question> <answer1> <answer2> ...: Create a poll with a
  short name as an identifier, a question to be answered, and as many answers as
  you like.
- poll vote <pollname> <answer>: Set your response to a poll. Re-voting changes
  your vote.
- poll results <pollname>: Show results from a poll.
- poll list: Show all polls with their question and answers.
- poll delete <pollname>: Delete a poll forever.

- wa <text>: Make Wolfram Alpha query with brief results
- waa <text>: Make Wolfram Alpha query with extended results

- clear <n>: Delete the n most recent messages in the channel
- tex <maths>: Render maths as LaTeX code (assumed to be between $$)
- metro <train line>: Get the status of <train line> on the Melbourne metro
- weather: Get today's weather
- astro: Get the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

The quotes channel is monitored for messages of the form "Foo: bar" or "Foo [bar]: baz".
They are automatically added to the quotes database and announced at random times.
- quote <text>: Search for quotes containing text, or pick a random one if no text.
